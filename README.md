# AmeliaInference

This repository contains the inference code for the model introduced in the paper below: 

#### Amelia: A Large Dataset and Model for Airport Surface Movement Forecasting [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21185)]

## Overview

**AmeliaInference** is intended to be a standalone version of [AmeliaTF](github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaTF) used only for inference purposes without the training/evaluation/testing overhead code. 

If you're interested in training trajectory forecasting models, please refer to [AmeliaTF](github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaTF). 

## Pre-requisites

#### Dataset

To run this repository, you first need to download the amelia dataset. Follow the instructions [here](https://ameliacmu.github.io/amelia-dataset/) to download the dataset.

Once downloaded, create a symbolic link into  ```datasets```:

```bash
cd datasets
ln -s /path/to/amelia .
```

### Installation

This repository requires the AmeliaTF, it can be installed following the instructions [here](https://github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaTF/INSTALL.md). Once installed, in the same environment follow the instructons in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaInference/INSTALL.md). However, you can intall the Amelia Framework following the instructions [here](https://github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaScenes/INSTALL.md).

## How to use

Activate your amelia environment (**Please follow the installation instructions above**):

```bash
conda activate amelia
```

Run the testing script:

```bash
python run_inference.py -m tests=[test_name]
```

where:
* `[test_name]` is the name of the test to run. The tests files are in a `yaml` format and are located in the `configs/test` directory. The default test is `default.yaml`. The test files contain the configuration for the test, including the model, the dataloader, the dataset, the device, the seed, and the output directory.
 

### Example

The next example shows how to change the test file to `example_kbos_critical.yaml`, which is a test file that uses the KBOS dataset and the critical model and it is included in th erepository as an example.

```bash
python run_inference.py -m tests=example_kbos_critical
```

Produces the following output in the `output` directory:

```bash
output
  |-- KBOS_26_1672610400_critical_ego
    |-- .hydra
    |-- kbos_scene_*.png
  |-- KBOS_26_1672621200_critical_ego
    |-- .hydra
    |-- kbos_scene_*.png
```
where:

- `KBOS_26_1672610400_critical_ego` and `KBOS_26_1672621200_critical_ego` are the directories with the specifications configured in the `example_kbos_critical.yaml` file.
- `kbos_scene_*.png` files are the images with the predictions generated by the model for each scene.
